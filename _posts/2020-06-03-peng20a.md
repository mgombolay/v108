title: A PTAS for the Bayesian Thresholding Bandit Problem
abstract: In this paper, we study the Bayesian thresholding bandit problem (BTBP),
  where the goal is to adaptively make a budget of $Q$ queries to $n$ stochastic arms
  and determine the label for each arm (whether its mean reward is closer to $0$ or
  $1$). We present a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the BTBP with runtime
  $O(f(\epsilon) + Q)$ that achieves expected labeling accuracy at least $(\opt(Q)
  - \epsilon)$, where $f(\cdot)$ is a function that only depends on $\epsilon$ and
  $\opt(Q)$ is the optimal expected accuracy achieved by any algorithm. For any fixed
  $\epsilon > 0$, our algorithm runs in time linear with $Q$. The main algorithmic
  ideas we use include discretization employed in the PTASs for many dynamic programming
  algorithms (such as Knapsack), as well as many problem specific techniques such
  as proving an upper bound on the number of query numbers for any arm made by an
  almost optimal policy, and establishing the smoothness property of the $\opt(\cdot)$
  curve, etc.
