title: Coping With Simulators That Don’t Always Return
abstract: Deterministic models are approximations of reality that are easy to interpret
  and often easier to build than stochastic alternatives. Unfortunately, as nature
  is capricious, observational data can never be fully explained by deterministic
  models in practice. Observation and process noise need to be added to adapt deterministic
  models to behave stochastically, such that they are capable of explaining and extrapolating
  from noisy data. We investigate and address computational inefficiencies that arise
  from adding process noise to deterministic simulators that fail to return for certain
  inputs; a property we describe as ’brittle’. We show how to train a conditional
  normalizing flow to propose perturbations such that the simulator succeeds with
  high probability, increasing computational efficiency.
